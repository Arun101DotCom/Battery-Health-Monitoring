# Battery-Health-Monitoring
Predictive analytics platform for estimating Battery State of Health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL). Features hardware-efficient ML models for real-time energy monitoring.

# Battery State-of-Health (SOH) Estimation Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **State of Health (SOH)** and **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of Lithium-ion batteries. This is a core component of my future commercial strategy for fleet-based energy monitoring.

## 🔬 Methodology
The pipeline analyzes charging/discharging cycles to identify patterns in capacity degradation.
* **Features:** Voltage curves, Current profiles, and Temperature fluctuations.
* **Modeling:** Regression-based models and Neural Networks to estimate health percentage.
* **Goal:** A scalable monitoring solution for industrial battery banks and EV fleets.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib).
* **Machine Learning:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor.

## 📈 Commercial Vision
This research is designed to be integrated as a secondary service in my industrial monitoring platform, providing a holistic view of both motor and energy storage health for large-scale engineering fleets.
